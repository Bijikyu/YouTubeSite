The file `index.js` is the main server module for a web application built with Express.js. It is configured to handle various routes related to users, videos, subscriptions, comments, and likes. The server is designed to serve static files, particularly in a production environment, and it establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

Key features of this server module include:

1. **Express Framework**: The server is built using Express, a popular Node.js web application framework.
2. **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is enabled, allowing the server to accept requests from different domains.
3. **Body Parsing**: The server uses `body-parser` to parse JSON and URL-encoded form data, as well as `cookie-parser` to handle cookies.
4. **Database Connection**: Configuration for MongoDB is imported, and a connection is established, with success and error messages logged to the console.
5. **Routing**: The server defines specific routes for handling API requests related to users, videos, subscriptions, comments, and likes. Each route is associated with its respective module.
6. **Static File Serving**: Uploaded files are served as static assets from the `/uploads` directory. In a production environment, static files from the `client/build` directory are served, and all routes default to serving the `index.html` file.
7. **Port Configuration**: The server listens on a port specified by an environment variable or defaults to port 5000.
8. **Server Initialization**: The server starts listening on the configured port and logs a message indicating successful startup.

This setup is typical for a full-stack JavaScript application that uses Node.js on the backend and serves a front-end client, potentially built with a framework like React, in production.
