The provided file descriptions detail the functionality of various Express router modules used in a web application, each handling different aspects of the application's features:

1. **comment.js**: Manages comment-related routes, allowing users to save new comments to a database and retrieve comments for a specific post. It uses the Comment model and populates the 'writer' field to include user information associated with each comment.

2. **like.js**: Defines routes for managing likes and dislikes on videos and comments. It includes functionality to retrieve, add, and remove likes and dislikes, ensuring that likes and dislikes are mutually exclusive actions.

3. **subscribe.js**: Handles subscription-related routes, enabling users to subscribe to other users, check subscription status, view the number of subscribers, and unsubscribe. It utilizes the Subscriber model to manage subscription data.

4. **users.js**: Sets up user-related routes for authentication, registration, login, and logout. It uses the User model to manage user information and the auth middleware to ensure that certain routes are protected and accessible only by authenticated users.

5. **video.js**: Establishes routes for video-related operations, including uploading video files, saving video information, retrieving video details, and generating thumbnails. It uses the Video and Subscriber models, auth middleware for route protection, multer for file uploads, and fluent-ffmpeg for video processing tasks like thumbnail generation.

Each file exports its router module for integration into the larger application, allowing for modular development and clear separation of concerns within the application's backend.
