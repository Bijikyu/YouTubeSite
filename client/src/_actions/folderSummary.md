The provided descriptions pertain to two JavaScript files that are part of a user authentication system in a web application.

1. **File: types.js**
   This file defines constants representing action types related to user authentication processes. These constants include `LOGIN_USER` for the login action, `REGISTER_USER` for registration, `AUTH_USER` for checking authentication status, and `LOGOUT_USER` for logging out.

2. **File: user_actions.js**
   This file contains functions that dispatch actions to handle user authentication tasks. It imports the action types from `types.js` and uses `axios` to make HTTP requests to a user server, whose URL is imported from a configuration file. The functions in this file correspond to the action types defined in `types.js` and include:
   - `registerUser(dataToSubmit)`: Sends a POST request to register a new user and dispatches a `REGISTER_USER` action with the server's response as the payload.
   - `loginUser(dataToSubmit)`: Sends a POST request to log in a user and dispatches a `LOGIN_USER` action with the server's response as the payload.
   - `auth()`: Sends a GET request to check the user's authentication status and dispatches an `AUTH_USER` action with the server's response as the payload.
   - `logoutUser()`: Sends a GET request to log out a user and dispatches a `LOGOUT_USER` action with the server's response as the payload.

In summary, these files work together to manage user authentication actions within a web application, with `types.js` providing the action type constants and `user_actions.js` implementing the functions that make server requests and dispatch actions based on those constants.
