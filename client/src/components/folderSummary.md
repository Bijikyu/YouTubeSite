The `App.js` file is a React component that serves as the main layout and routing mechanism for a web application. It utilizes React Router for navigation and includes a Suspense component from React for lazy loading components with a fallback loading display. The app's structure consists of a navigation bar (`NavBar`) at the top, a content area with specific styling, and a footer (`Footer`) at the bottom. The routing logic is protected by an authentication Higher Order Component (`Auth`) with varying access levels: unrestricted access, restricted to logged-in users, and restricted to non-logged-in users. The routes are defined for the landing page, login page, registration page, video upload page, video detail page, and subscription page.

The `Config.js` file contains configuration settings for the application, specifically defining server route constants. It exports a constant named `USER_SERVER` that specifies the endpoint for user-related API interactions.

Together, these files configure the web application's server communication and user interface routing, ensuring that components are loaded as needed and that users are directed to the appropriate pages based on their authentication status.
