The `VideoDetailPage.js` file defines a React functional component that serves as the detailed view page for a video. This page includes the video player, video details, comments, and the ability to like or dislike the video, as well as related side videos. The component uses React hooks such as `useEffect` and `useState` to manage state and side effects.

Upon mounting, the component makes two POST requests using Axios to fetch the video details and comments from the backend. It uses the `videoId` obtained from the URL parameters to make these requests. The video details and comments are then stored in the component's state.

The page layout is structured using the `Row` and `Col` components from the `antd` library to create a responsive grid. The main content is displayed in a larger column, which includes the video player, a list item with the video writer's avatar, name, description, and actions for liking/disliking and subscribing. The `Subscribe` button is conditionally rendered based on whether the video writer's ID matches the logged-in user's ID.

The `SideVideo` component is placed in a smaller column and displays related videos. The `Comment` component is included to show and add new comments, with a `refreshFunction` to update the comments state when a new comment is added.

If the video details are not yet loaded, the component renders a loading message. The `VideoDetailPage` component is exported for use in other parts of the application.
