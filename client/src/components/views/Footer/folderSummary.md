The file `Footer.js` is a React functional component that is used to render a footer element for a web application. It utilizes the Ant Design (`antd`) library, specifically the `Icon` component, to display a smile icon alongside the text "Happy Coding". The footer is styled with inline CSS to have a height of 80 pixels and is centered both horizontally and vertically. The text within the footer is set to a font size of 1 rem. This component is exported as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application where a footer is needed.
