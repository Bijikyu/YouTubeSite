The `LoginPage.js` file contains a React component for creating a user login interface. It utilizes Formik for form handling, Yup for input validation, Redux for state management, and Ant Design for UI components. The component allows users to input their email and password, with the option to remember the login details for future sessions. It includes error handling to provide feedback when login credentials are incorrect. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the home page. The component also offers links for users to reset their password or to register a new account. The `LoginPage` component is exported with routing capabilities provided by the `withRouter` higher-order component from `react-router-dom`.
