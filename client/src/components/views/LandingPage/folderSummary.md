The `LandingPage.js` file contains a React component that serves as the landing page of a web application, primarily showcasing a collection of video content. The component utilizes React hooks, specifically `useState` and `useEffect`, to manage the state and lifecycle of the video list.

Upon mounting, the component performs a GET request using Axios to an API endpoint (`/api/video/getVideos`) to fetch video data. If the data retrieval is successful, the component updates its state with the list of videos; otherwise, it alerts the user of the failure to fetch the videos.

The videos are displayed using a grid layout provided by the Ant Design (`antd`) library, with each video represented by a card. The card includes a thumbnail image that links to a detailed video page, the video duration formatted in minutes and seconds, the title of the video, the avatar and name of the video's creator, the number of views, and the creation date formatted with the `moment` library.

The layout is responsive, with different column sizes specified for large (`lg`), medium (`md`), and extra-small (`xs`) screen sizes. The video duration is overlaid on the thumbnail image, and the video creator's avatar is part of the card's metadata (`Meta`).

The component is styled with inline CSS and includes a section title "Recommended" above the video grid. The `LandingPage` component is exported at the end of the file, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
