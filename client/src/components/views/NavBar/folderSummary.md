The `NavBar.js` file contains the implementation of a NavBar component designed for a web application using React. It utilizes a functional component approach with React hooks for state management. The component integrates with the Ant Design library to provide pre-styled UI elements such as a Drawer, Button, and Icon. The NavBar is composed of a LeftMenu and RightMenu, both of which can be displayed horizontally across the navigation bar or inline within a Drawer that is toggled for mobile views. The NavBar itself is styled to be fixed at the top of the page and spans the full width. The file includes a CSS import for additional styling and provides a mobile-responsive button to reveal the navigation Drawer. The NavBar component is exported for use across the application. There is a minor typo in the class name 'menu_rigth' which should be corrected to 'menu_right'.
