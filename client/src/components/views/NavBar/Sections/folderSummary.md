The `LeftMenu.js` file contains a React functional component that renders a left-side navigation menu using the Ant Design library. It imports React and specific components from 'antd', such as `Menu`, `SubMenu`, and `MenuItemGroup`. The `LeftMenu` component itself returns a `Menu` with items like "Home" and "Subscription" for navigation, although there is a noted issue with duplicate keys for the menu items which should be unique.

The `RightMenu.js` file defines a React functional component for a right-hand side navigation menu, which also uses the Ant Design library. This component is more complex as it includes user authentication features. It imports React, `Menu` from 'antd', `axios` for HTTP requests, and several other modules for routing and state management, including `withRouter` from `react-router-dom` and `useSelector` from `react-redux`. The `RightMenu` component displays different menu items based on the user's authentication status, providing options for login, registration, video upload, and logout. The logout functionality is implemented with an `axios` GET request to a logout endpoint, and the component is exported with `withRouter` to enable routing.

Both components are designed to be part of a larger application, with `LeftMenu` handling basic navigation and `RightMenu` managing user authentication and related navigation. They showcase the use of React with Redux for state management and Ant Design for UI components.
